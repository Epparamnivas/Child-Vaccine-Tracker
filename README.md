# Child Vaccine Tracker â€“ Forked by Ramnivas Eppa

This is my personal fork of the **Child Vaccine Tracker** project originally created by [@akhilgaddam99](https://github.com/akhilgaddam99). 
The application is designed to help parents track vaccination schedules for their children, send reminders, and store vaccination history securely.

## ðŸ”§ My Contributions
As part of my contribution to this open-source project, I have:
- Enhanced the frontend user interface using HTML/CSS and EJS templating.
- Integrated backend modules in Node.js and Express.js for user authentication and profile management.
- Fixed bugs related to alert scheduling and form validation.
- Improved responsiveness for mobile views.
